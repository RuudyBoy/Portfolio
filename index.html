            <h3>How i changed it</h3>
            <p>To make the site responsive i first changed the section with buy and sell games on the homepage beacuse the content was to bis soit whent outside the of the screen. I fixed this by changing the margin of the "homepage_buy" class. I changed hte margin from 80px to 10px auto. I also changed the padding to 10px to give space for the content in "homepage_buy". I changed the grid columns on the content on the homepage from to columns to only one columns when the site is under 999px. This fixed the problem with the huge zoom on the page when opening on the phone.I also added a overflow:hidden to the the main so the site doesnt scroll horisontally when under 1000px </p>
            <p>Changed the size of the product image on the homepage beacuse the image went ut of the screen. Fixed it by changing width to max-width:100% over 1000px and to 60% under 999px.</p>
            <p>Changed the height of the background image by changin the min-heigth to 70vh over 1000px and 50vh under 999px.</p>
            <p> Fixed the games details page by changing the content of the innerHTML of the container in the gamedetails page. It was little content in the page and i added image and a description of the game. I used the same url as my project exam fot the api call so thats why the images and text are not relevant for a gamepage.</p>
            <p> Removed the div with the "sign-in content" class on the games details page beacuse it was just a unaccasary class on that page</p>
            <p> Fixed so the gamesgrid in the gamepage are aligned in the center of the page by changin the margin to auto and adding max-width to fit-content. The gameimage was also changed to max-width of 50% so it didnt take to much space</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Why i did it that way</h3>
            <p> I made the site respionsive this way beacuse i made this work on my project exam. Therefore i did the same on the Cross-course CA to make it work here as well. I changed hte gridcolumns so i looked more clean when scrolling on the mobile phone. It didnt look good when the content was in two columns.</p>
            <p> I changed all of the images with the max-width:0% beacuse i think % is working really well, beacuse it always adjusts to the screen size or the content the image is in. So the image is responsive all the way. </p>
            <p> I changed the background image this way beacuse i wanted the backgound image to take less space so the people could see the content and purpose of the site right away</p>
            <p> I changed the design and content on the game details page beacuse it was a site with little content. So i added content including image,text(description) and a h1 </p>

            <li> Removed the text decoration and text align on the h1,h2 and h3 in media queries beacuse it isnt neccasary to have the same code in normal and media queries. So now the font size is the only thing changed in media queries.</li>

        <div>
            <h3>How i changed it</h3>
            <p> Changed to only one unique h1 on the pages. i changed it by changing the some of the h1`s to h2 so it only remained one unique h1 on each page</p>
            <p> Removed the text decoration and text align by simply removing it from the media queries for h1,h2, and h3. Changed font size so the size of the is different in media queries</p>
            <p> Changed all backgrounds images on different pages to a class called visit_background, homepage_background etc. Fixed all background to be a image added in css instead of HTML. I did this by adding the class to a section , div or in the main.  Changed the height of the background to min-heigth: 55vh so the background takes less place.</p>
            <p> i fixed the contect form width by makin a width:100% on the class i put on the inputs in the contact form</p>
            <p> I changed the size of the events image by cropping the size to 200kb</p>
            <p> made lighter font for paragraphs by removing the font added to the paragraphs. So no font is added on the paragraphs. </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Why i did it that way</h3>
            <p>I changed the size of the background images beacuse it took to much place and the user had to scroll down to find the content.</p>
            <p> added space between the class and link in the nav element beacuse i wanted a cleaner code </p>
            <p> I changed the image on the contact page beacuse i felt the image didnt match the website.</p>
            <p> I have added lighter font to the paragraphs beacuse it was to bold and looked to important to be a text</p>

        <div>
            <h3>What was changed</h3>
        <ul>
            <li> Removed the border radius from the slider buttons</li>
            <li> Added a transition and bigger button when hovering the slider buttons</li>
            <li> Added transition and padding when hovering over a post in the slider</li>
            <li> Changed the size of the background image on the homepage under 1000px beacuse the image took to much space of the screen</li>
            <li> More design on the spesific blogpostpage,  a h2 and date the blog was published</li>
            <li> Changed the background heigth on the contact page</li>
            <li> Changed the size of the contact from when on mobile</li>
        </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>How i changed it</h3>
    
        <p> Added hovering on the slider buttons by adding :hover in css for both buttons. added the transition 0.5s for the transiton and added a different color so the buttons change color when hovering </p>
        <p> I added the transition and padding when hovering over the slider posts by adding transition 0.5s and padding to 10px in the :hover of the slider posts.</p>
        <p> Changed the size of the background image by fixing the heigth from 70vh to 50vh under 1000px</p>
        <p> Changed the background height on the contact page by fixing the heigth to ... </p>
        <p> I changed the size of the contact form on mobile by addin 30px margin instead of 10px and added max width on 70% under 1000px</p>
        <p> I dont know how to get the image via embed on the spesific blogpost page so i added the content rendered twice (content.rendered contains the image and text in the same file). On the first i took display none on the text so only the image shows. On the next content rendered i took display none on the image. Therefore i could add a h2 and a "by Christian Ruud" beetween the image and text. I couldnt do this if i only used the content.renderd once . </p>
        <p> added h2, a small text uder the image where it stands the author andwhen the site is published in the bottom- added this so i could add more details to the page</p>

    </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Why i did it that way</h3>
            <p> I removed the border-radius since everything else on the homepage hasnt a border radius. So it matched the design a lot better.</p>
            <p> I added hovering on the sliderbuttons beacuse i felt that it will give more life to the site.</p>
            <p> I added the transition and padding when hovering over the slider posts of the same reason as the slider buttons. i wanted it to feel more lively.</p>
            <p> Changed hte height on the background image on the contact page since it made uneccasary space on the page when its only a contactform on the page</p>
            <p> changed size of contact form on mobile since the form filled the entire screen and i wanted the form to have space on the sides</p>
            <p> I added two content.rendered to get the h2 in beetween as mentioned over. I did it like this beacuse i didnt know how to get the h2 between when the image and text is the same file i call from the API.</p>
