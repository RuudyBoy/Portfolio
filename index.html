            <h3>How i changed it</h3>
            <p>I changed the responsivnes to work by changin the margin from 80pxish to margin 10px auto. i also changed the padding to 10px to give space in the box.

            <p>added a overflow:hidden to the the main so the site doesnt scroll horisontally when under 1000px</p>
            <p>removed the catagory section on the gamepage</p>
            <p>Fixed that the product details page works as it should.</p>

        <div><h2>Project 2: Semester Project 1</h2></div>
        <div><h3>What was changed</h3>
        <ul>
            <li> Only one unique H1 on each page</li>
            <li> lighter font for paragraphs</li>
            <li> page on picture takes to much space</li>
            <li>The site is responsive which is good to see. HTML5 elements are used. Just worth noting that section elements should ideally have a heading element. 5.8mb on the events page. Some filenames have a capital first letter. Filenames should be lowercase. The active_page class in the nav element doesn’t have a space between it and the link. So rather than a href="Events.html"class="active_page" rather just have a space a href="Events.html" class="active_page". Font stylesheets should be above your own stylesheet. Otherwise you reference a font before the browser knows about it. Also, best to combine Google stylesheets together. Some classnames have capital first letters. Best to be consistent and keep them lowercase. Indenting of nav element is off. Text-decoration and text-align are added twice for h1, h2, and h3. You can just change the font size in the media query if that’s the only thing changing. Header images have alt text saying they’re background images. In the report the student says they first wanted to put the image in via CSS. The main consideration for putting images as HTML or via CSS is whether or not it’s content. If it is content, then it should be in the HTML. If it’s for styling, then it should be added via CSS. The reason stated for moving to HTML was to avoid repeating styles. That’s a good thought, but you can do that simply by using classes. For example: header__img { background-size: cover; background-repeat: no-repeat; background-position: top; } header__home { background-image: url(“images/home.jpg”); } header__about{ background-image: url(“images/about.jpg”); } It’s important to note that you can add multiple classes to the same html element.</li>
            <li>make a contact form with JS</li>
            <li>add a cool hover on homepage on the buttons</li>
            <li>Change the image size</li>
        </ul>
