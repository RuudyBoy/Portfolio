            <h3>How i changed it</h3>
            <p>To make the site responsive i first changed the section with buy and sell games on the homepage beacuse the content was to bis soit whent outside the of the screen. I fixed this by changing the margin of the "homepage_buy" class. I changed hte margin from 80px to 10px auto. I also changed the padding to 10px to give space for the content in "homepage_buy". I changed the grid columns on the content on the homepage from to columns to only one columns when the site is under 999px. This fixed the problem with the huge zoom on the page when opening on the phone.I also added a overflow:hidden to the the main so the site doesnt scroll horisontally when under 1000px </p>
            <p>Changed the size of the product image on the homepage beacuse the image went ut of the screen. Fixed it by changing width to max-width:100% over 1000px and to 60% under 999px.</p>
            <p>Changed the height of the background image by changin the min-heigth to 70vh over 1000px and 50vh under 999px.</p>
            <p> Fixed the games details page by changing the content of the innerHTML of the container in the gamedetails page. It was little content in the page and i added image and a description of the game. I used the same url as my project exam fot the api call so thats why the images and text are not relevant for a gamepage.</p>
            <p> Removed the div with the "sign-in content" class on the games details page beacuse it was just a unaccasary class on that page</p>
            <p> Fixed so the gamesgrid in the gamepage are aligned in the center of the page by changin the margin to auto and adding max-width to fit-content. The gameimage was also changed to max-width of 50% so it didnt take to much space</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Why i did it that way</h3>
            <p> I made the site respionsive this way beacuse i made this work on my project exam. Therefore i did the same on the Cross-course CA to make it work here as well. I changed hte gridcolumns so i looked more clean when scrolling on the mobile phone. It didnt look good when the content was in two columns.</p>
            <p> I changed all of the images with the max-width:0% beacuse i think % is working really well, beacuse it always adjusts to the screen size or the content the image is in. So the image is responsive all the way. </p>
            <p> I changed the background image this way beacuse i wanted the backgound image to take less space so the people could see the content and purpose of the site right away</p>
            <p>I changed the design and content on the game details page beacuse it was a site with little content. So i added content including image,text(description) and a h1 </p>

        </div>
        <div><h3>What was changed</h3>
        <ul>
            <li> Only one unique H1 on each page</li>
            <li> lighter font for paragraphs</li>
            <li> page on picture takes to much space</li>
            <li>The site is responsive which is good to see. HTML5 elements are used. Just worth noting that section elements should ideally have a heading element. 5.8mb on the events page. Some filenames have a capital first letter. Filenames should be lowercase. The active_page class in the nav element doesn’t have a space between it and the link. So rather than a href="Events.html"class="active_page" rather just have a space a href="Events.html" class="active_page". Font stylesheets should be above your own stylesheet. Otherwise you reference a font before the browser knows about it. Also, best to combine Google stylesheets together. Some classnames have capital first letters. Best to be consistent and keep them lowercase. Indenting of nav element is off. Text-decoration and text-align are added twice for h1, h2, and h3. You can just change the font size in the media query if that’s the only thing changing. Header images have alt text saying they’re background images. In the report the student says they first wanted to put the image in via CSS. The main consideration for putting images as HTML or via CSS is whether or not it’s content. If it is content, then it should be in the HTML. If it’s for styling, then it should be added via CSS. The reason stated for moving to HTML was to avoid repeating styles. That’s a good thought, but you can do that simply by using classes. For example: header__img { background-size: cover; background-repeat: no-repeat; background-position: top; } header__home { background-image: url(“images/home.jpg”); } header__about{ background-image: url(“images/about.jpg”); } It’s important to note that you can add multiple classes to the same html element.</li>
            <li>make a contact form with JS</li>
            <li>add a cool hover on homepage on the buttons</li>
            <li>Change the image size</li>
